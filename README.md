# Tinder
Here we have used NodeJS, MongoDB and JavaScript as base language.
Two parts are available:
1. FrontEnd: React
2. BackEnd: MongoDB, NodeJS, JavaScript

Overview of the project: This app works similar to tinder. There we have a swiping functionality. Here also we tried to develop the same. We can swipe right the profiles 
we like and dislike the ones we don't like. We have a functionality of messaging to the profiles we like.
